Some of the projects contain: 

- Cluster search with chromosomes (genetic algorithms)
- Traveling salesman with hill climbing
- Traveling salesman with chromosomes
- Traveling salesman with MIACO ant colony optimization (genetic algorithms)
- Least Squares Method for regression
- Gradient descent for regression
- One vs All method
- Artificial Neural Networks
